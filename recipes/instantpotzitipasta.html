    <h2>I <u>Hate</u> Recipe Blogs</h2>
        <p>
            So, the project wants us to write a couple of paragraphs describing the recipe, followed by the unordered ingredient list and then an ordered steps list. 
            As someone who frequently tries to find new recipes online, I absolutely <em>abhor</em> blog style recipes. So, in lieu of typing a "couple of paragraphs" 
            about the recipe, I will instead force you to sit through (that's right - no "jump to recipe button!") a list of dad jokes!
